Django Semantic UI admin theme
------------------------------
A completely free (MIT) [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) admin theme for Django. Actually, this is my 3rd admin theme for Django. The first was forgettable, and the second was with [Pure CSS](https://purecss.io/). Pure CSS was great, but lacked JavaScript components.

Semantic UI looks professional, and has great JavaScript components.

Log in to the demo with username `admin` and password `semantic`: [https://semantic-admin.com](https://semantic-admin.com)

Why?
----
* Looks professional, with a nice sidebar.
* Responsive design, even [tables can stack](https://semantic-ui.com/collections/table.html#stacking) responsively on mobile.
* JavaScript datepicker and timepicker components.
* JavaScript selects, including multiple selections, which integrate well with Django autocomplete fields.
* Semantic UI has libraries for [React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) and [Vue](https://semantic-ui-vue.github.io/#/), in addition to jQuery. This means this package can be used to style the admin, and custom views can be added with React or Vue components with the same style.
